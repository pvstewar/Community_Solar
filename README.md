# DSIP_Community_Solar
This repo is for the Data Science in Practice Community Solar Project.

In the spring semester the project built a dataset with the following information:
1. List of non-profit locations in Indiana from the Indiana Data Harvest dataset
2. GIS dataset to determine US Department of Energy Disadvantaged Communities by census tract
3. GIS dataset to determine target energy communities by cencus tract
4. GIS dataset to determine energy provider and types for Indiana
5. Code to run these locations through Google Maps Solar and Places APIs to gather additional location details.

See the notebook for information about downloading the datasets. A text file with a link to a pickle backup file is included and can be loaded by running the appropriate load cell in the notebook. 

There is also a Colab Version of the project notebook here: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1B14NA0SVLDeGAkjkeHW4QharoPGIyFkA/view?usp=sharing

A companion web application was built by Sama here: https://github.com/srisama/CommunitySolarProjectPoc
