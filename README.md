# DSIP_Community_Solar
This repo is for the Data Science in Practice Community Solar Project.

See the notebook for information about downloading the datasets. A pickle backup file is included and can be loaded by running the 
appropriate load cell. This will be updated as we move forward with the project as long as we can keep the backup under the file size
limit for the github repo which is explained here:
